# Analyzing Traffic Accidents

## Project Overview
The goal of our project is to **explore and analyze traffic incident data** gathered by the Estonian Traffic Authority from 2011 to 2021. We aim to understand the causes of traffic accidents, and the relationships between different characteristics and types of traffic incidents.

## Resources
- **Notebook**: The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, `mudel.ipynb`.
- **Data Source**: Data is sourced from `Liiklus√µnnetused_2011_2021.csv`.

## Getting Started
If you encounter any issues opening the notebook, refer to this guide on [how to launch a Jupyter Notebook from your terminal](https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-launch-jupyter-notebook-from-your-terminal/).

## Replication Instructions
To replicate our results:
1. Open `mudel.ipynb`.
2. Run all the cells in the notebook.
